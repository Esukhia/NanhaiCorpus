The Nanhai Corpus's "LEMMA" folder contains python scripts that are "under construction". The full set will contain a lemmatizer that tags words by headword; it is to be part of the larger POS and word segmenter tool currently under development. 

late 2016: the TshegRegex strips corpus files of their final tshegs for analysis purposes (so corpus analysis tools don't see token instances like ཡིན་ & ཡིན། as different words, for example). 

January 2017: A very simple stemmer was created to help make readability lists. The stemmer uses regex rules to simplify words to their stem (or root) form.
